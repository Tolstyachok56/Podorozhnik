### TRIPS TRACKER
Enter the current balance of the transport card, add trips on various types of public transport and monitor the card's balance. At the beginning of the month, the number of accumulated trips on the transport card is automatically reset.

### STATISTICS
Separate statistics of expenses per month/day for each type of transport.

### DOES NOT NEED CONNECTION TO THE NETWORK
You can keep track of your travels anywhere, anytime!

### IMPORTANT
The application is intended solely for manual trips tracking and is not synchronized with the transport card. All data entered in the application are reference and can not be a basis for complaint of a discrepancy with the actual transport card's replenishments and expenses.
